# Face_recognition-Development
This is a project created to build a face recognition using two raspberry pi pico w and two nrf24l01 modules, with a server using Flask
It's important to use the following libraries for the nrf24l01 module https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/drivers/radio/nrf24l01/nrf24l01.py
The transmitter and the receiver codes were made for run on micropython.
